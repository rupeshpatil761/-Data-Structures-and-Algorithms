	 * Merge Sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that efficiently sorts a list or array
	 * It works by recursively splitting the list into two halves, sorting each half, and then merging the two sorted halves together.
	 * 
	 * Time Complexity:
		Best case: O(n log n)
		Worst case: O(n log n)
		Average case: O(n log n)
		
		** Merge Sort has guaranteed O(n log n) time complexity in all cases, but it uses O(n) extra space.
		
		QuickSort has average time complexity of O(n log n) but has a worst-case of O(n²) (which can be avoided by using randomized pivoting).

		Merge Sort is much faster, with time complexity O(n log n) compared to O(n²) for Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort.
