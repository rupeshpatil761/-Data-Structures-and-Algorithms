/**
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.Callable} and
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.Future}
 * in Java to get results from your threads and to allow
 * your threads to throw exceptions. Plus, Future allows you to control your
 * threads, checking to see if they’re running or not, waiting for results and
 * even interrupting them or de-scheduling them.
 * <p>
 * {@link java.lang.Runnable}
 * is the default abstraction for creating a task in Java. It has a single
 * method {@link Runnable#run()}
 * that accepts no arguments and returns no value, nor it can throw
 * any checked exception. To overcome these limitations, Java 5 introduced a new
 * task abstraction through {@link java.util.concurrent.Callable} interface.
